/**
 * Copy for the public marketing surface.
 *
 * Two rules govern this file:
 *  1. Be specific. No "all-in-one platform", no invented customer counts.
 *  2. Be honest. The modules under `shippedModules` exist in the CRM today.
 *     Anything still being built is labelled as such, rather than hedged with
 *     the word "direction" — which is how the previous copy leaked internal
 *     phase language onto a customer-facing page.
 *
 * No icon imports: the redesign carries hierarchy with type and hairlines
 * instead of a decorative icon grid.
